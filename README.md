# reminder

Reminder is basically the result of following the tutorial by @miguelgrinberg (https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

Now I use it as a base to experiment and develop my first app: Reminder (provisional name). That seeks to remind the user to contact someone else. 

For more technical details I recommend to go directly to Miguel's blog or see his original code on github
